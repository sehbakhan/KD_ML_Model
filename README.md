## KD_ML_Model

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:

pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

# Dataset
This project uses the Kidney Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains features such as age, blood pressure, specific gravity, and other medical attributes.

# Dataset Structure
Attributes: [List the attributes used in your analysis, e.g., Age, Blood Pressure, Blood Glucose, etc.]
Label: The target variable indicating kidney disease presence classification column.

# Data Preprocessing
Before model training, the dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps:

Handling missing values
Data normalization or scaling
Encoding categorical variables

# Model Training
In this section, you can detail the algorithms implemented:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
Neural Networks
Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using cross-validation and the confusion matrix. You can display classification reports and visualizations to illustrate model performance.

Usage
To use the trained model for predictions
